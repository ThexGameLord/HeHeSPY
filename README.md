# HeHeSPY

*edit: this was all made by one person so if it is bad then sorry ðŸ¤£*
<br>
<br>
<br>
probably messy but eh i just want to make a service that works<divider>**(even partially)**

**I am no professional so some things will seem a bit off but it works for the logging in and some things,**
**Still trying to figure out the buddy system and saving and sending buddylists, maybe use mysql or something else? ðŸ¤”**

this project uses REDIS to save accounts and etc **(more to come)**
accounts can be banned by setting **banned** from 0(unbanned) to 1(banned)

yes even that exe is required to run in the same directory as the HeHeSPY.py file to decode passwords sent from the clients **for now**

if GPSP is going to be on a different server it will need a copy of the HeHeSPY.py file with it so it can use some things from it
but better to just have it all in one place for compatibility and i havent tested them seperated so on one server is recommended.
