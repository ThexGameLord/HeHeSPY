# HeHeSPY

probably messy but eh i just want to make a service that works<divider>**(even partially)**

this project uses REDIS to save accounts and etc **(more to come)**
accounts can be banned by setting **banned** from 0(unbanned) to 1(banned)

yes even that exe is required to run in the same directory as the HeHeSPY.py file to decode passwords sent from the clients

is GPSP is going to be on a different server it will need a copy of the HeHeSPY.py file with it so it can use some things from it
but better to just have it all in one place.
